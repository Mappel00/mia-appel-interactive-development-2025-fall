                <h1>My collection of art stuff started off small such as a pen here and there but the longer and farther I got into art the more intense my collection got. Now going from one pen to a whole water color palette and brushes with paper. </h1>
       
                <h2>With those memories comes the times where I went shopping with my family and how they were confused what each item was used for. My collection is the memories that art brought to me and the happiness that I have when using that stuff to create art.</h2>
